# Daoprover: Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Decentralization Validation

Welcome to DAOprover! This repository contains a collection of machine learning models designed to validate the decentralization of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).

## Overview

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) represent a new paradigm in organizational structures, relying on decentralized decision-making processes often facilitated by blockchain technology. The validation of decentralization within DAOs is crucial for ensuring their integrity, resilience, and effectiveness in operating autonomously.

## Models Included

The Daoprover repository includes the following machine-learning models:

1. **GAT**
2. **SAGE GNN**
3. **Autoencoder
