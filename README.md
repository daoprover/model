# Daoprover: Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Decentralization Validation

Welcome to DAOprover! This repository contains a collection of machine learning models designed to validate the decentralization of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).

## Overview

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) represent a new paradigm in organizational structures, relying on decentralized decision-making processes often facilitated by blockchain technology. The validation of decentralization within DAOs is crucial for ensuring their integrity, resilience, and effectiveness in operating autonomously.

## Models Included

The Daoprover repository includes the following machine learning models:

1. **Model 1**: *Description of Model 1 and its purpose.*
2. **Model 2**: *Description of Model 2 and its purpose.*
3. **Model 3**: *Description of Model 3 and its purpose.*
   <!-- Add more models as necessary -->

## Usage

To utilize the models provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Daoprover.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Model Directory**: Enter the directory of the model you wish to use:
